The pull_request_template file is not currently being managed by Terraform due to issues with cross repo permissions that require the use of a PAT or GitHub App.

The team are looking into the use of GitHub App, for now, to view where the file should be deployed please see the [repositories.tf](./../repositories.tf) file within this repo.
